.SYNOPSIS
    Wraps the `Invoke-CreateCanarytokensAD.ps1` script which is called for all OU
    entries in `-OUFilename` file.

.NOTES
    For this tool to work, you must have your Canary Console API enabled, please
    follow this link to learn how to do so:
    https://help.canary.tools/hc/en-gb/articles/360012727537-How-does-the-API-work-

    ###################
    How does this work?
    ###################
    1. Create a file eg: -OUFilename ComputerOUs.txt that has a line for each OU you'd like to target.
       Each line can be an OU Name or an OU DistinguishedName.
       You can use: Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -like "*"' | Format-Table DistinguishedName -A
       to get the desired list.
    2. Run powershell as a user that has remote read/write access on the admin shares
    of the remote hosts 'namely C$' ... either log in as such user, or use `runas /user:...`
    3. Provide your Console domain + API auth
    4. Type the full path of the OUFilename


.EXAMPLE
    .\Invoke-CreateCanarytokensAD-Wrapper.ps1 -OUFilename "/Full/Path/TO/ComputerOUs.txt"  -TargetDirectory secret -TokenType aws-id -TokenFilename aws_secret.txt
    creates an AWS-ID Canarytoken, using aws_secret.txt as the filename, and place it under c:\secret
    for all Computers in all OUs listed in `-OUFilename`.

Param (
    # Full canary domain (e.g. aabbccdd.canary.tools),
    # if empty, will be asked for interactively
    [string]$Domain = '',

    # API Auth token,
    # if empty, will be asked for interactively
    [string]$ApiAuth = '',

    # Set the target Directory on hosts' root
    # tokens will be dropped at 'c:\$TargetDirectory'
    # e.g. 'c:\Backup'
    # will be created if not exists
    [string]$TargetDirectory = "Backup",

    # Valid TokenType are as follows:

    #   "msword-macro":"MS Word .docm Document",

    # if you change $TokenType, make sure to pick an appropriate filename extension in next line
    [string]$TokenType = 'doc-msword' ,
    [string]$TokenFilename = "credentials.docx",

    # Name of the file containing OU Names or DistinguishedName. One OU per line.
    # Use: Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -like "*"' | Format-Table DistinguishedName -A
    #      to create such a file.
    # Example Entry: OU=Legal,OU=OurWorkstations,DC=stretch,DC=local
    # Each computer in this OU will have a token dropped to it.
    # The user that invoked the script should be able to map and write to admin shares
    # on those hosts.
    # if empty, will be asked for interactively
